This spring is a great time to sell your Phoenix home. Here are three reasons why.

Spring is my favorite time to sell real estate. If you are looking to sell your home, there are three reasons why we are in a very strong seller’s market right now:

**1. Demand continues to increase while inventory remains low.** The number of homes for sale is down 8% year over year. Why? The job outlook is strong, and more millennials are coming into the market.

**2. Home prices are still surging.** We have appreciated 6% year over year, and I don’t see that changing anytime soon.

**3. Interest rates are rising.** Right now, interest rates are at 4.5% for a 30-year fixed mortgage. Although that is a three-year high for interest rates, it is still historically low and very affordable for buyers. I don’t know how much longer this favorable situation will last.

If you are looking to sell your home, now is a great time. Demand is high and prices are high, so our current market is very favorable for sellers.

If you’re interested in finding out what your home is worth, we would be happy to come by and let you know what we can sell it for, how long it’s going to take, and what we’ll do to make that happen.

If you have any other real estate questions, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
