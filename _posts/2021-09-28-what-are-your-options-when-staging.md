Did you know that proper home staging will net you 7% more on your home sale? It seems like a small thing, but it makes a big difference in the minds of buyers. That’s why today I want to go over some important things to remember when staging your home.&nbsp;

First off, **stagers are professional interior designers.** When a stager works on your home, they visit the property and decide what type of staging best suits your space. Afterward, they’ll bring in their professional staging furniture to make it truly stand out to buyers.&nbsp;

Another option is to use your own furniture. Whether you want to save the inconvenience or time, stagers can accommodate your needs. They’ll use their professional eye and tell you what items you should remove and what you should add.&nbsp;

**There are countless ways to go when staging your home**, and what’s best for you comes down to your wants and needs. If you want the contact info of a great stager, please reach out to us via phone or email. We have great contacts and are always willing to help\!
