If you are wondering how an agent earns their commission, here is a rundown of everything we do for our clients.

How do we agents earn our commission? There are six important ways:

1. We identify and solve problems quickly by providing solutions to our clients.

2. We pre-qualify buyers. If I am your listing agent, it is my job to ask buyers the right questions so you can go under contract with one who is fully qualified and can close within the escrow period.

3. We manage expectations. I need to manage expectations for my clients so they know what the process is like and we can work together to execute it properly.

4. We have communication skills. We have to communicate with both our clients and the public at large. We get paid to tell the truth, which is difficult sometimes because of market conditions we have no control over. Part of these communication skills also involves forecasting whatâ€™s to come in our market in the near future.

5. We can find buyers for our seller clients. One of my favorite things to do in my job is prospect for buyers.

6. We can effectively and efficiently guide buyers and sellers through the whole home sale process. I have a full-service team working with me, and our whole goal is to prevent clients from waiting on me. Rather, my team should be waiting on them.

When people hire me, my ultimate goal is to get them the most amount of money in the least amount of time.

If you would like to know more about how I am able to accomplish this goal or you have any other real estate questions, please feel free to reach out to me. I would love to help you.
