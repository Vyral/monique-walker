Is a cash offer always best? Not always. I’ll go over when a cash offer is and isn’t necessarily your best option when selling your home.

As a seller, is a cash offer always your best option? You may be surprised, but the answer is no.

Cash offers are great if you need a fast close and don’t care about getting the absolute best price the market will bare. However, if you do want top dollar for your home sale, we will take about 90 days from start to finish.
