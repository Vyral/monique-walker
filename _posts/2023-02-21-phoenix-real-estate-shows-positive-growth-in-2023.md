The Phoenix real estate market is showing positive signs of growth in the first quarter of 2023. According to recent market stats, supply and demand, as well as inventory, are key factors in the current state of the market. With just 3.5 months of supply, the market is currently considered a seller's market, which means that there are more buyers than there are properties for sale.

**The demand for properties is also on the rise**, with contracts up compared to the previous month. This increase in demand is a positive sign for sellers who have been waiting to put their homes on the market. The average list price to sales price is 96%, which means that homes are selling for almost the full asking price. Moreover, 61% of all inventory is selling, which is great news for sellers.
