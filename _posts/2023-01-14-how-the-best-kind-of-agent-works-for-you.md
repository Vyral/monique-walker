What do I do to sell homes? I love that question. To answer that, I have one question for you: Did you know that there are two types of agents? There are passive ones and active ones, and I'm an active agent. This means that **when you hire me to sell your home, I will spend all of my time actively and aggressively marketing your home** to potential and qualified buyers and other agents.&nbsp;

For example, **each week, my team reaches out to 500 buyers and sellers**â€”that's how we proactively and aggressively find your home a buyer. We don't just put it on the MLS and wait, as many other agents do. If you're looking for an active agent, call or message me anytime. I'd love to help.
