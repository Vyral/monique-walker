Today, I wanted to do something a little different and share my favorite podcasts with you! These are some of the podcasts that help inspire me to be the best version of myself:&nbsp;

**1\. Light It Up.** If you want to learn the best real estate techniques from national experts, there isn’t a better podcast out there than this.&nbsp;

**2\. Wholesale Hotline/Bigger Pockets.** These podcasts are all about real estate investing and building long-term wealth.&nbsp;

**3\. Kute Blackson and Ed Mylett.** Both of these experts specialize in developing your mindset. If you’re looking for extra motivation, look no further.

Hopefully, you found this list interesting. If you have questions about this topic or anything else, just call or email me. I’d love to hear from you!
