It’s a very challenging market for buyers right now. Even so, one of our buyer’s agents, Francine, has won eight contracts so far this year with the implementation of a solid strategy.&nbsp;

We’ve been waiving appraisals, and if the buyer is comfortable, we also implement an appraisal shortfall. So if the appraisal comes in lower than expected, the buyer can commit to paying some amount over that appraised value.&nbsp;

**This is helping us protect** **buyers so that they're not paying an unlimited amount of money**. They’re only paying what they’re comfortable with. From the time that we work with a client to the time we submit a contract, we’re speaking with the listing agent very often because communication is key to helping buyers in this market.
