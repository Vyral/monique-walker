It’s a very challenging market for buyers right now. Even so, one of our buyer’s agents, Francine, has won eight contracts so far this year with the implementation of a solid strategy.&nbsp; She recently joined me to talk about it in detail.

We’ve been waiving appraisals, and if the buyer is comfortable, we also implement an appraisal shortfall. So if the appraisal comes in lower than expected, the buyer can commit to paying some amount over that appraised value.&nbsp;

This is helping us protect **buyers so they're not paying an unlimited amount of money**. They’re only what they’re comfortable with. From the time that we work with a client to the time we submit a contract, we’re speaking with the listing agent very often because communication is key to helping buyers in this market.
