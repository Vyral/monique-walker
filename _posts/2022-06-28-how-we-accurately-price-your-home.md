We use a holistic approach to ensure we reach the most accurate pricing for your home. One of the first things we'll go over during an appointment with sellers is how we go through this process. Today weâ€™ll give you a sneak peek into how our team ensures accurate home pricing.&nbsp;

**The first step in the home marketing process is to identify the most accurate pricing strategy for your home.** We approach this challenge by first looking at national housing trends and interest rates before seeing how those factors impact your area. We also closely look at the total number of sales, which price points are selling, and the overall average days on market. Lastly, we determine how your city's market conditions could impact your home value.&nbsp;

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.
