Today I’m joined by Troy Peterson from the Fidelity National Title Agency, who has helped me compile a list of great questions that consumers have been asking him about real estate. Together, we’ll tackle these questions so that you have a better understanding of the process.

**“I’ve heard that homes are selling fast and for more than the asking price. Why do I need a Realtor to help me sell my home when I could just pocket that money?”**

Yes, you could sell your home on your own, but the benefit of a Realtor is that we can generate multiple offers for your listing. That leads to competition among buyers, which in turn can lead to you receiving much more than your asking price. A Realtor can net you the most money, especially in a competitive market. More than price, we also help you get the best terms.

**“If homes are selling for over asking price, then shouldn’t I put my house on the market at a really high price and only come down if I needed?”**

That certainly is a strategy. I usually tell my sellers that they have two options. List it at market value, generate multiple offers, and then get top dollar when it does sell; or list it higher than market value and get fewer showings, which will usually only help your competition. So you need to decide if you want to help your competition or if you want to get more exposure for *your* listing. I always lean toward pricing it correctly at fair market value and being more aggressive with our marketing so that we can get as many eyes on your homes as possible.

If you’re curious about what your home is worth or you’re looking to buy a home, the Monique Walker Team would love to help you. Don’t hesitate to reach out to us\! We’re here to serve you.
