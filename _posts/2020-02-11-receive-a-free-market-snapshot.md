Would you like to know what your home is worth? Today we’re going to discuss a free service I offer called a market snapshot. If you want to know what your home is worth, have a rental property you want to keep updated on, or you know where you want to move and wish to keep track of that specific area, I have a simple tool that can help.&nbsp;

[Click here to receive a specific market snapshot.](http://www.phoenix-house-value.com/){: target="_blank"} Simply input your information, and then you can get a report of that zip code. This is not an accurate home value report to know exactly what your home is worth, but it gives you an idea of what’s happening in that area. **If you want to know what the list-to-sales price ratio is, how long it’s taking homes to sell, what new properties have come onto the market, and so on, that’s the kind of data you’ll receive** from a market snapshot.&nbsp;

For a completely accurate value of your home, you can call or email me directly. Also, feel free to reach out to me with any questions about the market snapshot or real estate in general. I would love to help you\!
