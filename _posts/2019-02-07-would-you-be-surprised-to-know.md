Our market is simply full of surprises lately!

First of all, though we’re still in a seller’s market, we’re currently experiencing the largest inventory of homes we’ve seen in a long time. Our number of months of inventory—or how long it takes to sell all homes currently on the market—is at 3.06.

On top of this, in the last 30 days, we’ve had the lowest number of homes sold. Together, these factors mean that our market could be balancing out. It also means that it’s now easier for people to sell their homes and purchase new ones.

As each area has its own unique market, so if you want to find out more about your specific neighborhood, your best bet is to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
