I’ve been selling real estate for 16 years and my team and I are so grateful for all of our clients who keep coming back to us time and time again.&nbsp;

**I’ve designed our amazing team so that you are always waited on, but you’re never waiting on us.**&nbsp;

Melani Beauregard is a buyer specialist who puts all of her energy into her clients. She treats them like family, she listens, and she executes a plan of action to find them the perfect home.

Ann Csincsak is also a buyer specialist on our team. She loves taking buyers out and educating them about the process. A lot of agents will be happy to sell you a house, but not happy to teach you the process. Ann loves teaching her clients and making this a simple process for her client’s busy schedules.

There are a few team mottos we have that are kind of like life mottos. They are:

**1\. We always do what’s best for the client<br>2\. Our performance outsells other agents’ promises<br>3\. We’re kind, proactive, aggressive, and very professional agents**

If you or someone you know is thinking about purchasing or listing a home any time in the near future, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
