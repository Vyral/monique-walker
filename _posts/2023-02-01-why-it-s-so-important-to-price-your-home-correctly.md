The first question that all buyers will ask me before they look at a home is “How long has that home been on the market?” Right now, the average number of days that a home stays on the market is 44, and that continues to go up. **That’s why it's more important now than ever for you to list your property at the right price and find the best agent to work for you.**

Of course, I would love to be that agent. Call or message me anytime, as I would love to hear from you.
