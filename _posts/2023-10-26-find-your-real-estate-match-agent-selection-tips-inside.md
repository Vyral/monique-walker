Whether you're a first-time homebuyer, a seasoned investor, or someone looking to sell their property, selecting the right real estate agent is essential. Today, we will explore a set of key questions to ask potential real estate agents during the interview process. Here are a few questions that you'd want to ask real estate agents:

**1\.** How long have you been in the business of selling real estate?

**2\.** How many buyer sellers have you helped in the last 12 months?

**3\.** What techniques do you use to help your clients get their offers accepted?
