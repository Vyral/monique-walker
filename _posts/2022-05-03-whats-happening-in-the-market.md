Has the market cooled off? No way\! Although rates are at 5.1%, the Phoenix-Scottsdale real estate market is as hot as I've ever seen it in my 19 years of selling real estate.

I recently showed a 3,200-square-foot house in Arcadia that was listed at $2 million. It was only on the market for 30 minutes before there was an offer of $50,000 above list price. My team also put a home on the market in Chandler that was listed at $675,000. We received 18 offers, sold it for $753,000, and negotiated a two-month free rent back for the seller. We also listed a 1,400-square-foot property in Gilbert for $525,000. We were able to bid up the price to $542,000.

**There's never been a better time to sell real estate.** Call me if you'd like to take advantage of this killer seller's market and I'll show you how my team's performance will outsell all those promises out there. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me by phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
