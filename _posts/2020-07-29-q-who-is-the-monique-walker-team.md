Who exactly is The Monique Walker Team? It’s a group of amazing professionals that are completely dedicated to serving our clients.

About 10 years ago, I had an epiphany about our business. I never want our clients to wait on me. I want our clients to feel like they are waited on. So who are these amazing team members?

**First, we have buyer’s agent Melanie Beauregard,** who helps me prospect for buyers and helped 50 buyers herself last year.

**Next, we have our listing coordinator, Monica Mendoza.** She’s our concierge for our sellers and my right-hand gal when it comes to marketing.

**Shannon Newell is our transaction coordinator.** She dots the i’s, crosses the t’s, and makes sure we get to the finish line with a smooth transaction.

**Behind the scenes, we have Diann Barker, Sara Baker, and my husband**, who is our operations manager.

I created this team for our clients and to be able to give them smooth transactions. Our team was created to serve you at the highest level, and our goal is to help you get the best price in the quickest amount of time.

If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
