Have you got a house that’s more ‘fixer-upper’ than ‘dream home’?

Selling it might feel like an uphill battle when buyers are spoiled for choice and have their pick of polished properties. Homes with obvious flaws can easily slip to the bottom of their list, leaving you with fewer offers—or none at all. But don’t lose hope! With the right strategy, you can still catch the eye of the right buyer and turn that ‘needs work’ into ‘worth it.’ Here are three steps to help you sell a house that needs repairs:

**1\. Get a home inspection.** You know the house needs work, but do you know exactly what needs fixing? A home inspection will give you a comprehensive list of all the issues that must be addressed. Once you know what has to be fixed, you can decide whether to make the repairs, invest in replacements, or sell the home as is. Just remember: disclosing any issues to potential buyers is required by law. Transparency is crucial in avoiding legal problems down the road.

**2\. Consider selling to an investor.** If your home is in terrible shape, selling to an investor might be the best route. Real estate investors buy homes to repair and resell for a profit, not to live in them. They often pay cash and purchase properties “as is,” making the process quick and straightforward. Investors look for homes they can fix up, so the worse the condition, the bigger the pool of potential buyers. Alternatively, you might also attract bargain hunters—buyers looking for a deal willing to do the work to make the home their own, especially if the location is correct.

**3\. Set a realistic price.** No matter what market we’re in—whether it’s a buyer’s or seller’s market—pricing your home correctly is crucial, especially for homes that need work. Setting a reasonable price based on research and market conditions can make or break your sale. This is where working with a real estate professional comes in. An experienced agent can provide valuable insights, resources, and connections to help you price your home competitively and attract serious buyers.

Selling a home that’s more ‘work in progress’ than ‘move-in ready’ doesn’t have to be overwhelming. With the proper steps, you can turn challenges into opportunities. One person’s ‘fixer-upper’ could be another’s dream project. So, price it wise, be upfront about the work needed, and aim for the right buyers.
