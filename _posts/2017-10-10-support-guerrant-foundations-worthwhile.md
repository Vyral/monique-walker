Anne Guerrant has traveled the globe as a professional tennis player. During her travels, what she saw in much of the developing world appalled her. Debilitating poverty. Families living on less than $1 a day.

Anne and her husband, Terry, started The Guerrant Foundation to help these people by giving them small loans to start businesses. They make it easy for many people to be part of something bigger than themselves.

The Guerrant Foundation's biggest fundraiser of the year is coming up. The 8th Annual Battle of the Sexes Tennis Festival will be held on Saturday, November 4th from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. at The Phoenician (6000 E Camelback Road). This year, Anne and Terry are matching 100% of all the donations they receive and all of that money is going directly to help these budding entrepreneurs.

The loans they provide aren’t hand-outs, they are hand-ups. The loans go to smart, capable, driven entrepreneurs who need just a little bit of capital to achieve liftoff. Since the foundation started, Anne and Terry have been able to help thousands of people around the globe write a new chapter in their family’s life.
