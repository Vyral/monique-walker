We are still in a great seller’s market here in Phoenix; **we have very little inventory and tons of demand.** We only have a 2.2-month supply of homes. Last month we had buyers from Chicago, Minneapolis, and California purchase our listings, as well as people within our city.&nbsp;

People are attracted to Arizona because of our home prices, spread-out land, low cost of living, and wonderful interest rates between 3% and 3.5%. Though sales are still down about 30%, it’s because of our low inventory. We can help you safely buy or sell, even amid the pandemic.&nbsp;

If you have questions about what your home may be worth or anything else concerning real estate, call, text, or email us. We’re here to help.
