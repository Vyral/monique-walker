I’m excited to have Troy Peterson of Fidelity National Title Agency join me once again as we continue our real estate Q&A series. Today I’m answering two more important questions.

***“The last housing correction was over 10 years ago, aren’t we due for another one?”***

You would think so. Our market typically cycles every five to seven years, but we’ve been in this one for a decade. Although we’re technically due for one, I don’t see one on the horizon based on our current supply and demand.

***“Good investors always sell high and buy low, so why would I want to buy now?”***

That’s a really good question. Are you more price-conscious or rate-conscious? Pricing is going to continue to go up over time, even if we have a downward cycle to go through. If you want a low monthly payment on your investment, however, we don’t know how much longer they’ll stay where they are.

If you have any questions for us about buying, a home, or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
