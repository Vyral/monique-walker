Today I’m alongside **Tom Ross with Bay Equity Home Loans** and, together, we’re here to discuss our current interest rate environment.&nbsp;

By the end of this May, we saw a notable development with regard to interest rates: **The combination of tariffs and various other economic conditions are driving rates down, and this downward trend doesn’t look like it’s going to slow or move in the other direction anytime soon.**

Although market indicators tell us that rates will continue their current trajectory for the next year or so, it’s worth pointing out that, last year, we were confident that rates would continue to rise well into the high-5’s. It wasn't until the Fed signaled a change of course in their policy decisions early this year that we knew we could see rates flatten out or begin to fall.&nbsp;

All things considered, **conditions are very favorable at this moment, and it’s a great time to get into the market.** &nbsp;

Whether you’re considering buying or refinancing, go ahead and give Tom a call at 602-791-5861. We’d love to help you as a team\! And if you have any other questions regarding your real estate needs, please reach out to me as well. We hope to hear from you soon\!
