Feeling overwhelmed by today’s housing market? Selling a home in today’s market requires a different mindset compared to previous years. The market dynamics have shifted, and the quick sales that many homeowners became used to in 2021 and 2022 are no longer the norm. If you’re looking to sell your home this year, patience is crucial.

**Considering this, is it still a good time to sell? The simple answer is yes**. While market conditions have changed, it remains a good time to sell due to a persistent housing shortage. Demand for houses will remain strong as long as this shortage continues, leading to a balanced market where buyers and sellers have equal power.
