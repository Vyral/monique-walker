Reverse mortgages are for those who are at least 62 years old, have accrued a decent amount of equity (roughly 50%), and don’t want to have a mortgage payment for the rest of their lives.&nbsp;

A reverse mortgage is a fairly complex product that warrants an in-depth conversation with your financial advisor. **It’s geared for fixed-income individuals who want to stay in their homes while alleviating the burden of monthly mortgage payments.** It’s also advocated by financial planners whenever there’s a downturn in the stock markets and their clients don’t want to liquidate their assets; a reverse mortgage allows them to free up a cash pool and avoid pulling money out of stocks or bonds.&nbsp;

Essentially, a reverse mortgage gets paid off just like any conventional mortgage would, though it's structured differently. If, for example, a son or daughter finds themselves needing to sell the property of a deceased parent who had a reverse mortgage, they will have 12 months from the parent’s passing to sell the property. Since a reverse mortgage loan is not to exceed the home’s value, the proceeds from the sale of the property will pay off the loan.&nbsp;
