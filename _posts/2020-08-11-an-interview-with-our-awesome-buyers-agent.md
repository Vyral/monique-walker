Today I’m joined by Melani Beauregard, one of the Monique Walker Team’s awesome buyer agents, for an interview about her growth since joining our team.&nbsp;

Melani’s been in the real estate business for four years. In her first year, she closed fewer than 25 homes, but in her third year (after she joined us), she helped 48 families buy a home. Of course, our job isn’t just about closing deals; it’s about helping people. That’s why **her goal for 2020 is to help 70 families buy a home.&nbsp;**

As of the recording of this video, she has 32 closings to her name, along with 10 pendings. Our team doesn’t like to be normal, and those numbers aren’t normal—albeit in a *very* good way.&nbsp;

How did she double her production?

“Well, I have a mindset that I decided I was going to surround myself with other successful people like yourself,” she says, “And I was very blessed to be invited to join your team. So, I feel like being around other people that are in the business and constantly reminding myself that I don’t know everything and that there’s always room to grow. And then just taking each experience that I’ve had and learn from it wholeheartedly. And then just constantly wanting to have the best for my clients.”&nbsp;

In the two-and-a-half years Melani has been with us, she’s been able to identify our strengths in the form of a list she titled “What Being on the Monique Walker Team Means to Me.” **These strengths include, in her words:**

* Having positive influences
* Accountability&nbsp;
* Strong integrity
* Professional and experienced staff&nbsp;
* Consistent lead flow (“There’s so much to go around I can’t to it all by myself.”)
* Achieving my goals
* Endless coaching&nbsp;
* Striving to always by my best&nbsp;
* A fun, positive environment
* Financial freedom&nbsp;
* I’m so busy I don’t have time to do my nails 😄

For any agent who’s looking to join a team and needs a little more support, I think it’s a powerful message for them to know that they can do more—they just need the right environment. If anything Melani mentioned today struck a chord with you and you want to achieve the same growth in your career, you can because **we’re looking for another agent to join our team.&nbsp;**

As Melani said, she can’t handle all of the leads herself. We need someone who matches our drive, hustle, and enthusiasm, so if you’re interested in filling this position, don’t hesitate to call me today. I’d love to speak with you.&nbsp;

As always, if you have any other questions, feel free to reach out to me as well. I’m here to help.
