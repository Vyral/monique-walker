Today I’m not going to talk about real estate. Instead, I want to highlight SEEDs for Autism, a nonprofit that works with youth and adults on the autism spectrum. I’ll be asking Mary Ann, the director for SEEDs for Autism, about the organization, what they do, and what we can all do to help.&nbsp;

**So Mary Ann, how does SEEDs for Autism help people on the autism spectrum?**

We work directly with folks on the autism spectrum to teach them vocational, life, and social skills. The work we do is all product-driven, so they aren’t just doing arts and crafts. They’re creating tools people can use in their gardens, kitchens, and more.&nbsp;

**That sounds wonderful\! Can people purchase these products?**

They can\! If you [visit our website](https://www.seedsforautism.org/), you can find a shop where all the products we make are available.&nbsp;

**As the founder of SEEDs for Autism, how did you create this organization?**

This nonprofit is a collaboration between local artisans, professionals, business owners, and adjunct instructors. We try to teach our students as much as we can so that they understand the customer service, marketing, and social sides of what we do here. We want to provide as many transferable skills as possible and give them a purpose.&nbsp;

I would like to thank Mary Ann for taking the time to talk with me today. SEEDs for Autism is a wonderful organization, and the products they make reflect that. Once again, if you’d like to support them, visit their website at [www.seedsforautism.org](http://www.seedsforautism.org). Also, if you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’d love to hear from you\!
