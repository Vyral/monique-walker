In the past 12 months, homes in our county have been selling for 97% of their listed prices. This indicates that buyers need to present strong offers if they want to secure their desired homes, as lowball offers are unlikely to be taken seriously by sellers. For instance, if you're eyeing a home listed at $1 million, you would need to offer at least $970,000 or more to have a good chance of getting your offer accepted.
