Today I’ll share my prediction for the upcoming spring real estate market. I'm so excited for 2022 because it is such an amazing time to be a seller. Right now, we only have 1.3 months of supply. That’s exactly the same number of homes we had for sale last month.

**Here’s my prediction for what will happen in the spring market: It's going to be bananas.** We'll see prices escalate, more multiple offers, and the return of bidding wars.

This spring is going to be the best time to sell, so if you’d like a free market analysis on your home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you.
