Today I’m excited to be visiting **[Nielsen Design Studios](https://nielsendesignstudios.com/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}** in central Phoenix and speaking with owner Michael Nielsen himself about his business and how he can help you.&nbsp;

**His studio has been in business for 35 years, and they offer interior design consulting and products for both residential and commercial properties.** As you can see in the video, we’re standing right in the middle of their newest product: their outdoor kitchen. According to Michael, this kitchen takes indoor living to the outdoors, and it’s customized to accommodate what the client needs or what their space looks like.&nbsp;

How many kitchens can you choose from? The possibilities are endless. The style, coloring, configurations, and components are incorporated to fit your needs. With the ‘indoors out’ living environment, kitchens, dining spaces, and poolside lounging areas are all things Nielsen Design Studios can consult you on.&nbsp;

So if you’re thinking of adding an outdoor kitchen or another neat feature to your home, give Michael a call at (602) 997-6890 or send an email to [info@nielsendesignstudions.com](mailto:info@nielsendesignstudions.com). If you have questions for me about today’s topic or there are any real estate needs at all that I can assist you with, feel free to reach out to me as well. I’d love to hear from you.
