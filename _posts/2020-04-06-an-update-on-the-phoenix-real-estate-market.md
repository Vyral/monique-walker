The spring market has begun here in Phoenix, even amidst a global pandemic. I’m here today to deliver facts and dispel some myths about what you think the real estate market might be doing. Here in Maricopa County, sales actually went up from 500 on March 18 to 832 on March 25 and over 700 by March 31. Our governor has deemed real estate an essential business, and fortunately we haven’t been hit as hard as other states have.

If you have any questions about what I discussed in this video, or if you’re interested in buying or selling a home soon but aren’t sure how to proceed in these times, reach out to us. We’re always here to help and look forward to touching base with you.
