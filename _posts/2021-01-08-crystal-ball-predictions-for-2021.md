Today I’m sharing my real estate market predictions for 2021. If I had a crystal ball, I believe I’d see a wonderful market this year due to three factors:

**1\. Low inventory.** We currently have less than one month’s supply of homes, and I foresee that continuing throughout the new year.

**2\. Demand from California.** We have high demand in our market, especially from California buyers, and I don’t see that wave letting up anytime soon.

**3\. Low interest rates.** Our great interest rates drive the market right now; people are getting between 2.5% and 3%, and the Fed has said they won’t raise them for a while.

With all these elements, I think 2021 will be an excellent seller’s market, and we’re eager to get started.&nbsp;

If you’re considering buying, selling, or just have a question about the market, my team and I are here to serve you. Call or email us anytime. We’d love to be your real estate resource.
