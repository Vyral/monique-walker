What’s the best compliment I’ve received from a client? After helping a client close recently, they told me that it was a tidy sale. That may seem like an odd compliment to give a real estate agent, but in reality, it’s exactly what I’m going for! Real estate transactions can be very stressful, but they don’t have to be with the right communication.

For this sale, we priced our client’s home slightly below market value to create a bidding war. When multiple offers came in, we let all the buyers’ agents know to submit final offers on Monday so we could review them and choose what best fit our client’s needs. **At the end of the day, they got everything they wanted: a higher price, a quick close, and no repair costs.**

If you’re looking to sell a home this spring, my team and I would love to work for you. Just call or email us to learn more.
