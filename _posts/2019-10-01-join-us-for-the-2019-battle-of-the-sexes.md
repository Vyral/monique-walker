In the past, we’ve raised enough through this event in 12 years to help over 40,000 people. It’s my 10th year playing, and I’m so excited to play this year and raise even more money to help the poorest of the world's poor through small loans to start businesses. &nbsp;A tiny loan can help a woman in the developing world start a business and change the lives of herself and her children by providing a regular source of food, clothing, shelter, and education. &nbsp;It's the first step to ending the downward spiral of crushing poverty.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
