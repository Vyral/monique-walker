When hiring a real estate agent, you need to find a master negotiator. When it comes to getting you the best deal possible, don’t pick someone brand-new; hire someone with experience.&nbsp;

So what should you look for when hiring an agent? Make sure they have a lot of current inventory pending—five to eight homes is a good benchmark. They should also study the market every day to make sure they head into negotiations as prepared as possible.
