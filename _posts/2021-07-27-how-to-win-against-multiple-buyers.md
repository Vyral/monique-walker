My buyer’s agent Ann recently won a contract against 23 other buyers, so here are three things that she did to help her client win:

**1\. Credit towards concessions.** This is a certain amount of money set aside by the buyer for a seller to use for their title fees or just their bottom line.

**2\. Escalation clause.** Since we wrote this in, the seller knew that we would come in $2,000 over their next highest offer up to a certain amount.

**3\. Seller rent-back.** Allowing the seller to stay in their home for free for a month offered the convenience they were looking for and is what ultimately won the home for Ann’s buyers.

Convenience, clauses, and credits are what win a home in this market. If you’re looking to buy a home, my team and I would love to help you. Reach out to us today via phone or email if you have any questions at all.
