Hello, everyone from sunny&nbsp; Greater Phoenix area! Today, I'm excited to share our market update, highlighting five essential points that you should be aware of in our current real estate landscape.

**1\. Buying activity.** Despite a 33% decrease in sales in Maricopa County, real estate transactions are still happening actively. This indicates a market that, while slower, is still vibrant and bustling with opportunities for both buyers and sellers.

**2\. Stable pricing.** An interesting aspect of our current market is the stability in pricing. The average price has seen a 7% increase, while the median price remains consistent with last year's figures. This stability is a positive sign for both parties in the real estate process.

**3\. Buyers’ payment patterns.** Currently, buyers are paying 98% of the list price on average. This is a slight increase compared to last November, where the average was 97%. It suggests that buyers are still willing to pay close to asking prices for the right property.

**4\. Inventory levels.** The current inventory stands at about 18,000 homes, marking a 22% decrease compared to the same time last year. While this indicates a more competitive market, the adage goes: it's a price war and a beauty contest. If you're selling, pricing your property correctly and ensuring it's in top condition will lead to a successful sale.

**5\. Days on market.** The average days on market is around 55, almost identical to last year. This suggests a consistent pace in the real estate process, both for buyers and sellers. Buyers should note that while the frenetic pace of past markets might have slowed, competition still exists.
