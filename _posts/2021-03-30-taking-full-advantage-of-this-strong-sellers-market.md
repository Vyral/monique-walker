Right now in Maricopa County, we have about 9,800 units for sale. **Last month, we sold 8,900 units, leaving us with a roughly one-month supply of homes.** I can confidently say that in my 17 years of selling real estate, this is the hottest seller’s market I’ve ever seen. At the same time, it’s also the most challenging market for buyers.&nbsp;

If your home is in decent condition and priced reasonably, it *will* sell. However, getting the very best price for your home still requires some finesse and expertise. Too often, sellers focus only on price and neglect the importance of selecting an offer that has the best terms overall. We’d advise all sellers to put their homes on the market on Friday and wait till that following Monday to evaluate all offers.&nbsp;

It’s our job to correspond with buyers' agents in such a way that promotes bidding wars. We’ll also do everything in our power to get you the best terms. For example, can we remove the appraisal contingency? Can we ask the buyer to purchase your home in as-is condition? Do you want any extra terms? Perhaps you want to stay in the home for another 30 days.&nbsp;

We have the leverage to call those shots in this market. We’re here to do what’s best for you. **No two sellers have the same life priorities; whatever’s most important to you, we can make it happen.** So if you’re curious as to what your home is worth or you’re ready to sell, give us a call or send an email our way. We’d love to help you make the most of this opportunity.
