A common question I get asked is: “Should you take the first offer that you receive?” My answer is 90%, yes, 10%, no. Allow me to elaborate.&nbsp;

**The first offer you receive will be from your most motivated, excited, and enthusiastic buyer.** Why is that? This is because they were the first to see the property and the first to send an offer. This first buyer really doesn’t want to lose.

**Accept this first offer 90% of the time.** How do you decipher which first offers fall into the 10% camp? You can do that with an agent’s help. By hiring the right agent, they can guide you toward the best decision for your situation.

Call me so I can help you through that process, and let me know if you have any questions. I look forward to speaking with you.
