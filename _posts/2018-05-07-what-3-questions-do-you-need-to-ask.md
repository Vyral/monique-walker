Before hiring a real estate agent, you need to do some vetting. Here are the questions that we recommend you ask.

<div class="post-cta">
Buying a Phoenix Home? <a href="http://www.moniquesells.com/properties/#/" target="_blank">Search all Homes for Sale</a><br>
Selling a Phoenix Home? <a href="http://www.phoenix-house-value.com/" target="_blank">Check out our FREE Home Value Report</a>
</div>

Selling or buying a home can be one of the largest transactions of your life. A trusted consultant and Realtor can be an invaluable partner to have. When you interview a Realtor to hire, here are three really good questions to ask them:

**1. "How many homes have you sold in the last 12 months?"** It’s interesting to find out how long an agent has been in the market, but noting their productivity in the last 12 months is a better indicator of whether or not they are a productive, full-time agent.

**2. "Can I have the contact info for your last three deals?"** This question may be a surprise to the agent, but it could provide you with an honest, authentic answer to help you feel comfortable with them.

**3. "What specific strategies are you going to use to get my home sold?”** Some agents specialize in buyer sales. Some agents specialize in listing and selling. A specific, proven plan is essential for any buyer or seller.

To get my answers to these questions and more, feel free to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you today.
