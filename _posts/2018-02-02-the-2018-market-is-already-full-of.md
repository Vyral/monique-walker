What do you need to know about our 2018 market so far? Let’s find out in our first update of the year.

Happy New Year! Now that we’ve entered into 2018, it’s time for us to have our first market update of the year. Our current market is great for both buyers and sellers.

Sellers should know that we have 10% less inventory right now than we did last year. This means less competition for you.

It’s also a great time to buy because interest rates are still hovering around lows of around 4%. As always, I’m here to help you with whatever your real estate needs may be.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
