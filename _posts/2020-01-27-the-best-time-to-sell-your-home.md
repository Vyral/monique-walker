When is the best time to sell? I looked at last year’s data for Maricopa County and saw that most sales took place in May—more than 10,000, to be exact. It’s currently taking 60 days on average for a home on the MLS to go under contract, so to close in May, you’d want to list your home in March.&nbsp;

But to answer the question more directly: The best time to put a home on the market is when you’ve decluttered, repainted, shampooed the carpets, staged the property, and done everything else that’s needed to get it ready for the market.&nbsp;

**We’re in such a strong seller’s market, so the sooner you prepare your house the better\!** For data on your personal property and to know your home value, please reach out to me. I’m always happy to receive your call or email.
