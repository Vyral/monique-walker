What’s going on with the market? Today we'll talk about the changes that’re happening to real estate and share some market data.&nbsp;

We currently have 18,000 homes available, and we sold 5,800 homes last month. If we compare that with the numbers from the market peak in March, which had the most buyers and the lowest amount of inventory ever, the market has definitely changed. Our inventory has doubled, and we have about 30% less buyer demand.&nbsp;

**We are now in a traditional market.** If you're looking to sell and purchase, you have more options and opportunities. Also, it’s worth noting that the two best-performing markets right now are Paradise Valley and Fountain Hills.&nbsp;

If you need more details about this topic or anything related to real estate, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’m always happy to help\!
