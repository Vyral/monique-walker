It is crucial to thoughtfully prepare your home before you put it up for sale. A home that is correctly staged and prepped will sell for thousands of dollars more. However, how do you know where to start? There are a lot of things you could prioritize, and you don’t want to put your time and money into the wrong things. That is why I have created a list of three things to focus on when preparing your home:&nbsp;

**1\. Do the three d’s.** They are: declutter, depersonalize, and deep clean. These are the basics that shouldn’t be overlooked. Move as much of your stuff as you can into a storage locker or your friend’s garage temporarily to make your house look bigger. Take down your pictures and other personalized trinkets so potential buyers can picture their family in the home, not yours. Then make sure every surface is as clean as it can be, inside and out. Don’t forget about things like ceiling fans, windows, and gutters.

**2\. Hire a professional photographer.** It’s crucial that you don’t underestimate this. Just taking quick photos with your phone will not properly showcase your home. The photos and videos are what will draw potential buyers in, and if they aren’t good, then you won’t even get people to look at the house. The content needs to be high quality.&nbsp;

**3\. Consider the emotions.** You want to appeal to the emotions of potential buyers by making the home feel cozy and welcoming. Fix the temperature, light some candles, bring in the natural light, and do anything you can to make them feel at home. Also, make sure you keep your own emotions in check. It makes sense that this home means a lot to you, it’s a huge part of your equity, and you’ve made years of memories in it! However, get ready to detach yourself from it, and don’t let your emotions stop you from choosing an appropriate list price.&nbsp;
