Are you wondering what you should do to prepare your home for sale? My recommendation is to think of the three d's, which are declutter, depersonalize, and deep clean. **These are the basics that shouldn't be overlooked.&nbsp;**

First, declutter by moving as much of your stuff as you can into a storage locker, your garage, or even your friend’s garage. This will make your house look bigger, and less is better.&nbsp;

Next, take down all of your pictures and personalized trinkets so potential buyers can picture their family in your home, not your family.&nbsp;

Lastly, make sure every surface of your home is as clean and clear as possible, both inside and out. D**on’t forget things like ceiling fans, windows, and gutters.&nbsp;**

I have wonderful stagers that I can refer you to, and I’d love to help you as well by walking through your home and giving you my advice. If you're thinking about selling and need some advice about how to present your property at its best, call me. I would be happy to help you.&nbsp;<br>
