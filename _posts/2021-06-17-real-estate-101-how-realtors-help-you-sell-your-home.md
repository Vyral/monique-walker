Whether you’re young or old, real estate can be a tricky thing to wrap your head around. For many people who are new to the market, it’s often helpful to explain things in the simplest way possible. I like to educate buyers and sellers in a way that’s incredibly easy to grasp — in fact, it’s so straightforward that even kids can understand it.

**With the help of my daughter, today I’ll be explaining the seven steps a Realtor takes when helping someone sell their home:**

1. The seller calls the Realtor.
2. The Realtor does a walk-through of the house. A walk-through means going through the home and checking out its features, upgrades, and condition.
3. The Realtor determines the price. They usually do this by seeing what similar homes sold for recently.
4. The Realtor lists the home on the multiple listing service (MLS). This online platform is where Realtors post a home so that other Realtors and homebuyers can see it.
5. The Realtor shows the property to people who want to buy the house.
6. The Realtor negotiates with the buyer and their Realtor to find out what they’re willing to pay for the house.
7. The home is sold\! However, it still takes about 30 days before the sale is completed.

Although most of these steps can be a lot more in-depth, this is generally how we progress through the home selling process. If you have any questions or would like more information about buying or selling a home, feel free to reach out to me. **I look forward to hearing from you soon.**
