It is time to take a look at the latest market conditions. But alongside today’s update, allow me to also share a great, new listing.

It is time to take a look back at our April real estate market. But before we get into those statistics, I want to tell you about a great new listing.

Located at 3542 East Hazelwood Street, this 4-bed, 2-bath Phoenix property is one you will certainly want to check out for yourself. To see photos of this 2,000 square-foot, $675,000 home, click here.

Now let’s get back to discussing our market. Currently, we are still in a strong seller’s market. As of April, there were 10% fewer homes on the market than in April of 2017. And there were 4% more sales year over year, as well.

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or are curious about how market conditions will impact your real estate goals, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
