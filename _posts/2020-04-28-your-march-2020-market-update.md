What do the latest numbers say about our Phoenix market? Here’s how the numbers from March compare with those from March 2019.&nbsp;

The number of sales was identical, but inventory dropped 35%. What does this mean if you’re a seller? With just 1.6 months’ worth of homes, there aren’t a lot of properties out there. **Even amid the pandemic, buyers are still buying homes.**&nbsp;

It’s also interesting to note that 83% of all homes under construction are below the $500,000 mark. This means that that market is very speedy, while the higher-end market is slowing down a bit. There’s still a lot of demand, but some buyers (especially Midwesterners and Californians) are sitting on the sidelines because, obviously, they aren't able to come down here.&nbsp;

It will be a very exciting time once the pandemic subsides—our market is holding steady.&nbsp;

If you’d like to know your home’s value or what’s happening in your local area, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’m here to help.
