I usually get asked by sellers whose house was on the MLS but didn't sell this question: **"How long do I have to wait until my listing on the MLS can go back on the market** and be a fresh listing?‚Äù The answer is 45 days. After this time, your listing will become a new listing on the MLS, and days on market will go to zero.

If you're thinking about putting your home back on the market on the MLS, it's always a good idea to interview between two to three different top agents. Compare marketing plans, track records, and overall results, and just **make sure you have a good connection with your Realtor.** If you're thinking about doing that, I would love to hear from you. Please feel free to reach out to me by phone or email, and I will answer any questions you may have.
