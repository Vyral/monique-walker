The Battle of the Sexes 2019 is almost here\! There will be food, drinks, a raffle, and music. There will be plenty of fun for the whole family.&nbsp;

**Join us on November 2 at the Phoenician Resort (6000 E Camelback Road) from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. This is a free event to people of all ages and we’d love to see you there.**

In the past, we’ve raised enough through this event in 12 years to help over 40,00 people. It’s my 10th year playing, and I’m so excited to play this year and raised even more money. **To learn more, visit** **[www.guerrantfoundation.org](http://www.guerrantfoundation.org){: target="_blank"}.**

Anne Guerrant and I recently went on Good Morning Arizona to talk about the event. We also talked about Anne’s time playing with Billie Jean King, how and why the Guerrant Foundation was started, and what you can expect from this year’s event. **You can see the interview in its entirety starting at the 0:45 second mark in the video above.**

If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
