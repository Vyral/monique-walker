Everybody is looking for a way to get out and be active this summer, and my friends Elijah and Taylor joined me recently to talk about Arizona Athletics and their 2020 sports programs for kids.

Elijah is the President of Arizona Athletics. **This summer, they’re holding basketball camps every Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday from 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.** The camps are limited to 24 kids in a nice, big gym. They don’t social distance through the entire camp due to the nature of the game, but they do have temperature checks at the door, frequent hand washing, and limit distance as much as possible. If you’re not comfortable with that, they are also offering at-home and private training.

**The volleyball camps are taking all the same precautions with limited contact.** Again, there are some times during the camp where social distancing is not possible, so they are offering at-home training and private training as well.

The basketball camps are for those in grades four through eight. **It’s an intermediate camp**, so beginners might have a tougher time. For the really advanced seventh and eighth grade campers, they recommend the private advanced lessons.

**The volleyball camps are for those in grades three through eight, and they welcome players of all levels.** For those who are a little more advanced, they also have small group and private training.

You can find Arizona Athletics and their Youth Sports Programs at Archway Cicero, off the 1010 and Talking Stick exit.
