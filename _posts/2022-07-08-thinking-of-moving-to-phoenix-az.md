Are you thinking of moving to Arizona? We have many beautiful cities where you can enjoy clear blue skies all year round. If you like outdoor activities, Phoenix is surrounded by impressive mountains where you can go hiking. With only two hours of driving, you can be skiing in Flagstaff and exploring our endless trails.&nbsp;

Our 50-mile-long canal system runs from one end of the city to the other, and just beside the canal is a wide path that's perfect for running or biking. If you need to escape the city, drive two hours to Sedona, and you can experience the zen energy and much cooler weather.

Arizona tops Forbes' list of the five most entrepreneurial states with low business and property taxes. **It's a state with fantastic sights to explore and excellent career opportunities.** If you want to move here, don't hesitate to call or email me. I'll be happy to help\!
