Are you in the process of selling your home and wondering if it's all about the price? While securing a favorable selling price is definitely important, savvy sellers know there's more to a successful home sale than just the numbers. In fact, most sellers prioritize three key elements: convenience, certainty, and control. One often-overlooked aspect that significantly contributes to achieving these goals is the careful consideration of the terms in the sales contract.
