Many potential home sellers make their plans for the springtime, while others hope for a quick summer sale so they can move while the kids are out of school. It's often assumed that the fall and winter markets are quieter, if not dead altogether. However, there are numerous advantages to listing your home during the holidays, and today I’m highlighting three major ones:&nbsp;

**1\. Buyers who look for a home during the holidays are more serious.** If they’re pre-approved and willing to use their extra time off work to wiggle around busy holiday schedules and look at homes, they mean business. When it comes to the buyers in our end-of-year market, think quality over quantity.&nbsp;

**2\. Inventory levels are low.** Currently, there’s only a one-month supply of homes; fewer options for buyers means more money for you.&nbsp;

**3\. Job-related relocations are at their peak this time of year.** People who recently received a huge promotion or found a great new job in a vibrant area (like Phoenix) are rushing to find a home before their official January start date. Again, these types of buyers are just one segment of an exceptionally motivated buyer pool we see every winter.&nbsp;

If you’re thinking about selling soon (perhaps sooner than you’d originally thought in light of this information) and want to know how much your home is worth, I’d love to help you. Just give me a call or send an email anytime\! I’m here to serve you. Thank you for all of your support this year, and have a wonderful holiday season\!
