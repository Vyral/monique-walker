Where are buyers coming from? Buyers in our market are primarily coming from California, Washington, Colorado, and Illinois.

There are a lot more cash buyers in this market. However, only 30% of our buyers are actually providing cash to purchase, so donâ€™t be intimidated if you're getting a conventional loan.

Last year, our average price in Maricopa County was $350,000. Today it's $504,000. **That's a 43% increase.** The market's still trending upwards for the next six months. We may see a cooldown after that.

If you want to know what your home is worth, I always welcome your call.
