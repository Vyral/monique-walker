Our team is staying safe and healthy, and I hope you and your family are as well. My goal today is to share some facts with you that point to now being a surprisingly good time to list:&nbsp;

**1\. Inventory levels are incredibly low.** We already had low levels before this health crisis, but since some people are taking their homes off of the market now, listing yours will make it one of a select few options for buyers.&nbsp;

**2\. Buyers are serious.** Unless they absolutely need to purchase a home, you’d expect buyers to stay on the sidelines and wait for more normal circumstances to return. While you will have fewer showings if you list now, the quality of those showings will be higher than usual because only the most motivated buyers will be looking at your home.&nbsp;

**3\. Interest rates are very low.** Though buying and selling require creativity right now, some buyers feel it’s worth it to capitalize on these rates.&nbsp;

**4\. More online searches are happening now than ever before.** Buyers have more time than usual to search for homes online, and the impressions are up by 10x. Your home could appear in countless searches\!

Though the health crisis news is grim, the real estate industry is fortunate in the sense that the market is holding up quite well.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about what was discussed today, or if you’re interested in buying or selling a home soon but aren’t sure how to proceed in these times, reach out to us. Call, email, set up a Zoom meeting—whatever method works best, we’re always here to help.
