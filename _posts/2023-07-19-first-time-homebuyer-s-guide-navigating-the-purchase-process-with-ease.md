Are you thinking about buying your first home? If so, the process might be a little daunting if you don’t know what to expect, so I’m here with a quick overview.&nbsp;

**Start by calling a Realtor, and they will guide you through the whole process.** They will connect you with their preferred loan officer who will qualify you for a loan. There are many different options for loans, including VA, FHA, and conventional. To give you an example, if you’re buying a $450,000 home with an FHA loan, the down payment for that would be about 3.5%, which is approximately $15,000.&nbsp;

Once you find the perfect home, your Realtor will order an inspection for that home, which would include things like termite, air conditioner, and roof inspections. **With the guidance of a good agent who has credible resources, the home-buying process can be very smooth.&nbsp;**

I'd love to apply for the job of being your agent and helping you find your new home. You can call me anytime at (602) 413-8195. I'd love to help.
