One of the most common questions I’m asked in today’s market is, “Are there really any buyers still buying real estate in our area?” It’s true that activity is down 30% since its peak in 2022; however, that doesn’t tell the whole story. Most people don’t choose to move because interest rates are a certain number. Instead, they move based on significant life events, like marriage, divorce, childbirth, deaths, and more.&nbsp;

The truth is that staying put just isn’t an option for a lot of people. Considering that the job market is still strong, **I don’t think real estate is going to totally stagnate any time soon.**&nbsp;

If you need to move, I’d love to interview to be your agent. Just give me a call or send an email to set up an appointment. I look forward to hearing from you!
