Do you want to get a cash offer? I can help. The simple process of getting an offer without having to prepare your home, show it to buyers, and list it on the MLS sounds appealingâ€”no work, no showings, no hassle. However, how do you know whether the cash offer you received is the absolute highest net profit for you?

**Net proceeds are the money you put in the bank after all expenses are paid.** The best way to find out if the offer is good is by looking at nearby comparable homes that sold within the last three months. It's also important to look at all the homes that have sold on the market and off-market. Your Realtor will have that information.<br><br>If you want to get a cash offer or if you'd like me to evaluate a cash offer for free to ensure that you're getting the best price, call me. I look forward to helping you get the best price possible.
