Today I’m here with one of our agents, Melani Beauregard, to discuss ways to win as a buyer in today’s real estate market. It’s a very challenging time to be a buyer or buyer’s agent. There is very little inventory and tons of buyer demand, but Melani has successfully negotiated more than 60 buyer contracts during this difficult period. Here are a few tips to help you win as a buyer:

**1\. Get pre-approved.** Pre-qualification isn’t as good as getting pre-approved. Pre-approval means the buyer is almost completely underwritten, which helps to minimize the close of escrow time.

**2\. Find the seller’s motivation.** Have your real estate agent contact the seller’s agent to find out what the seller’s motivation is. For example, they may want to stay in the home a bit longer to have time to move. If we find out what’s best for the seller, the buyer can use that to get their offer accepted.&nbsp;

**3\. We match buyers to listings when possible.** On our team, we list many houses, so we try to match our buyers to listings before they even hit the market. Off-market properties are always a great option for buyers because there’s less competition for them.&nbsp;

If you’re looking for an aggressive, proactive, market-intelligent agent who cares about their clients, Melani is the one for you. Reach out to her via phone or email. If you have questions about winning in today’s market or anything else concerning real estate, contact the Monique Walker Team. We would love to help you.
