How do buyers search for homes? **Primarily, buyers search for homes online, with approximately 95% of them utilizing this method.** They typically search within specific price ranges, often in $25,000 increments. For instance, if a buyer qualifies for a $500,000 budget, they'll look for properties up to $510,000. It's crucial to consider this when determining your list price.

Pricing your home at $1,025,000, for example, might cause it to be overlooked by buyers searching for up to a million dollars. However, by pricing it at a million dollars, you open it up to all buyers looking in that range and below. The goal is to maximize the visibility of your home to attract the largest pool of potential buyers online.
