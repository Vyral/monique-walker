Often when I meet with clients, they want to list above my recommended price. I totally understand why–after all, everyone wants to get the most money possible for their home. However, there are some major risks associated with pricing your house too high.&nbsp;

For example, many buyers won’t even bother to view your home if they think it’s overpriced. Instead of hoping that one person comes along who will pay a higher price, wouldn’t you rather have many buyers all competing for your home? A bidding war will naturally drive up the price, so you may end up getting your high price even if you list below what you think it’s worth.&nbsp;

At the end of the day, **more showings mean more opportunities for you.** Call or email me if you’d like to learn more about pricing or just have some questions. I look forward to hearing from you\!
