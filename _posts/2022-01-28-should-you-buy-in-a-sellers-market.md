Should you buy in a seller's market? This is one of the most common questions I receive from my clients. If you’re wondering about this, you should think about whether you’d ever want to purchase in a buyer's market. **The great part about buying in our current seller’s market is that your new property will appreciate by about 2% every month.** For example, the average price point in Arcadia is a little over $1 million. If you buy it now, it’ll appreciate by $66,000 in just three months.&nbsp;

If you’re on the fence and thinking about purchasing or selling, my team and I would love to be a trustworthy resource for you. Call or email us, and we'll show you why our performance will outsell all of those crazy promises out there. I look forward to hearing from you.
