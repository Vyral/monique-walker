In the ever-evolving world of real estate, understanding how to strategically price your home can make all the difference in attracting potential buyers. Here's a secret that many might not be aware of: 95% of homebuyers initiate their search online, and they often use specific price increments in their searches.

**Buyers commonly look for homes within particular price ranges, often in $25,000 increments.** For instance, they might set their budget at $500,000 and search for properties up to $510,000. This means that if you choose to list your home just above these increments, say at $1,000,025, you might miss out on buyers searching for properties under a million.

On the flip side, if you list your home at a million dollars, you open your property up to both those searching for properties just below and those searching up to a million. The goal is to maximize your home's online visibility to attract as many potential buyers as possible.

Why is this important? **Because more visibility leads to more showings, and more showings often result in multiple offers, driving up the final sale price.** So, when it comes to pricing your home, keep these online search habits in mind. You want your property to catch the eyes of the most significant number of potential buyers.
