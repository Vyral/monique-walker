I’m coming to you today from a property that’s available for purchase at 4401 N 24th Place here in Phoenix. Right at the heart of the Biltmore area in a gated community, this 3-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom townhouse has 2,100 square feet of space. From the white cabinetry to the granite countertops, this is a truly beautiful property. Our asking price is $375,000, but if you’re interested, you’d better hurry—this property is likely to disappear from the market quickly. To see the home in gorgeous detail, watch this short video. If you’d like a private tour or more information on the property, please feel free to reach out to me.
