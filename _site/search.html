However, according to my guest today, Tom Ross of Bay Equity Home Loans, the last economic downturn was a once-in-a-century event, and the current market features a totally different set of circumstances.If you plan on staying in your home for at least three years, there are plenty of underlying reasons why now is a great time to buy.âThe last economic downturn was a once-in-a-century event, and the current market features a totally different set of circumstances.âAccording to the statistics, Phoenix is the fastest-growing city in the U.S. Not only are we ranked in the top 10% of all cities in terms of job growth, but weâre also in the top 20% in terms of historical appreciation.We have about 70,000 households being formed annually, but only 25,000 homes being built. To be exact, we have less than three months of inventory, and we donât see supply catching up to demand in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, appreciation is also expected to continue to rise.If you look at the big picture, itâs a great time to buy or sell, so if you plan on doing either anytime soon, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

Search all Homes for SaleSelling a Phoenix Home? Check out our FREE Home Value ReportIâm here today with my preferred lender, Tom Ross from Bay Equity, to discuss a question about interest rates: âWhat should you do about interest rates, knowing that theyâre on the rise?âTomâs short answer is: Lock your rate in now.People have it in their head that if they just wait long enough, theyâll end up with a lower rate eventually. But rates in the 3% area are long gone; at our highest this year, weâve brushed 5% and came back down into the high fours. This time next year, the 4% rates will be long gone as well.âTry not to turn down any showings, if possible.âThose in the market need to wrap their heads around the fact that this climb in rates weâre going into will be long-term and sustained. Weâre in the midst of a sort of trade war with China, and inflation tends to raise interest rates as well. In fact, the Federal Reserve has gone on record to say that theyâre going to raise the federal funds rate at least four times between now and the end of next year. Two of those jumps might occur even before the end of this year.Now the federal funds rate doesnât directly impact mortgage rates, but as it rises, you tend to see interest rates come up.If you have any questions for Tom about rising interest rates, you can reach him at Bay Equity by calling (602) 791-5861 or by sending an email to tross@bayeq.com.For any questions about real estate in general, we always encourage you to reach out to us here at RE/MAX Excalibur.

Check out our FREE Home Value ReportAre you in the process of getting your house ready to put on the market? If so, here are a few tips to help you:1. Donât overprice your home. Pricing is everything when marketing your home for sale. Even a well-priced home with a bad marketing plan will sell, but an overpriced home wonât.2. Failing to make repairs. If the dog chewed something up or there are other minor damages that a buyer would spot immediately, get those fixed before you get the property listed and start taking pictures.3. Neglecting to declutter your home. If you have a lot of personal items, boxes, or general clutter, thatâs one of the first things a buyer will notice. As part of our services, we bring a professional stager out to our buyersâ properties to help declutter and stage the property.âTry not to turn down any showings, if possible.â4. Donât turn down showings. To get your home sold quickly and for top dollar, it should be about when itâs most convenient for an agent to show your property, not the other way around.5. Getting overly emotional about your home. Think of your home as a property or an asset than as your home. This shift in mindset will help you maximize the sale price.If you have any questions for me or want to know why my performance outsells all those promises out there, give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you.",

If they can, theyâll put together a financial package that they can submit to their lender to request a loan modification. This package will consist of a hardship letter, their financial documents, and the lender application.If your application for a loan modification was turned down and you found the process intimidating or frustrating, theyâll make the experience much easier the second time around.âWe know that life happens, but there are options out there for you.âIf youâre on the verge of missing a payment, Mauriceâs first piece of advice is to contact your lender and inform them of your situation. Lenders have programs in their imminent default area that will consider a loan modification on your behalf before you become a delinquent.If you previously received a modification and youâre on the verge of becoming a delinquent again, you can apply for another modification, but you canât apply for the same reason as your previous application.We know that life happens, but there are options out there for you that can allow you to keep your home.
