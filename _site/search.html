However, according to my guest today, Tom Ross of Bay Equity Home Loans, the last economic downturn was a once-in-a-century event, and the current market features a totally different set of circumstances.If you plan on staying in your home for at least three years, there are plenty of underlying reasons why now is a great time to buy.“The last economic downturn was a once-in-a-century event, and the current market features a totally different set of circumstances.”According to the statistics, Phoenix is the fastest-growing city in the U.S. Not only are we ranked in the top 10% of all cities in terms of job growth, but we’re also in the top 20% in terms of historical appreciation.We have about 70,000 households being formed annually, but only 25,000 homes being built. To be exact, we have less than three months of inventory, and we don’t see supply catching up to demand in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, appreciation is also expected to continue to rise.If you look at the big picture, it’s a great time to buy or sell, so if you plan on doing either anytime soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

Who qualifies as a hero?

Search all Homes for SaleSelling a Phoenix Home? Check out our FREE Home Value ReportI’m here today with my preferred lender, Tom Ross from Bay Equity, to discuss a question about interest rates: “What should you do about interest rates, knowing that they’re on the rise?”Tom’s short answer is: Lock your rate in now.People have it in their head that if they just wait long enough, they’ll end up with a lower rate eventually. But rates in the 3% area are long gone; at our highest this year, we’ve brushed 5% and came back down into the high fours. This time next year, the 4% rates will be long gone as well.“Try not to turn down any showings, if possible.”Those in the market need to wrap their heads around the fact that this climb in rates we’re going into will be long-term and sustained. We’re in the midst of a sort of trade war with China, and inflation tends to raise interest rates as well. In fact, the Federal Reserve has gone on record to say that they’re going to raise the federal funds rate at least four times between now and the end of next year. Two of those jumps might occur even before the end of this year.Now the federal funds rate doesn’t directly impact mortgage rates, but as it rises, you tend to see interest rates come up.If you have any questions for Tom about rising interest rates, you can reach him at Bay Equity by calling (602) 791-5861 or by sending an email to tross@bayeq.com.For any questions about real estate in general, we always encourage you to reach out to us here at RE/MAX Excalibur.

Check out our FREE Home Value ReportAre you in the process of getting your house ready to put on the market? If so, here are a few tips to help you:1. Don’t overprice your home. Pricing is everything when marketing your home for sale. Even a well-priced home with a bad marketing plan will sell, but an overpriced home won’t.2. Failing to make repairs. If the dog chewed something up or there are other minor damages that a buyer would spot immediately, get those fixed before you get the property listed and start taking pictures.3. Neglecting to declutter your home. If you have a lot of personal items, boxes, or general clutter, that’s one of the first things a buyer will notice. As part of our services, we bring a professional stager out to our buyers’ properties to help declutter and stage the property.“Try not to turn down any showings, if possible.”4. Don’t turn down showings. To get your home sold quickly and for top dollar, it should be about when it’s most convenient for an agent to show your property, not the other way around.5. Getting overly emotional about your home. Think of your home as a property or an asset than as your home. This shift in mindset will help you maximize the sale price.If you have any questions for me or want to know why my performance outsells all those promises out there, give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you.",

Search all Homes for SaleSelling a Phoenix Home? Check out our FREE Home Value ReportSelling or buying a home can be one of the largest transactions of your life. A trusted consultant and Realtor can be an invaluable partner to have. When you interview a Realtor to hire, here are three really good questions to ask them:1. “How many homes have you sold in the last 12 months?” It’s interesting to find out how long an agent has been in the market, but noting their productivity in the last 12 months is a better indicator of whether or not they are a productive, full-time agent.“You want to get a sense that this agent is somebody you can trust.”2. “Can I have the contact info for your last three deals?” This question may be a surprise to the agent, but it could provide you with an honest, authentic answer to help you feel comfortable with them.3. “What specific strategies are you going to use to get my home sold?” Some agents specialize in buyer sales. Some agents specialize in listing and selling. A specific, proven plan is essential for any buyer or seller.To get my answers to these questions and more, feel free to reach out and give me a call or send me an email.

Check out our FREE Home Value ReportSpring is my favorite time to sell real estate. If you are looking to sell your home, there are three reasons why we are in a very strong seller’s market right now:1. Demand continues to increase while inventory remains low. The number of homes for sale is down 8% year over year. Why? The job outlook is strong, and more millennials are coming into the market.2. Home prices are still surging. We have appreciated 6% year over year, and I don’t see that changing anytime soon.“Our current market is great for both buyers and sellers.”3. Interest rates are rising. Right now, interest rates are at 4.5% for a 30-year fixed mortgage. Although that is a three-year high for interest rates, it is still historically low and very affordable for buyers. I don’t know how much longer this favorable situation will last.If you are looking to sell your home, now is a great time. Demand is high and prices are high, so our current market is very favorable for sellers.If you’re interested in finding out what your home is worth, we would be happy to come by and let you know what we can sell it for, how long it’s going to take, and what we’ll do to make that happen.If you have any other real estate questions, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

Check out our FREE Home Value ReportToday I’m joined by special guest Maurice Brundidge of One Home at a Time Housing Solutions to discuss how they can assist anyone who has missed several mortgage payments and is facing foreclosure.First, Maurice and his company perform a financial assessment of that individual or family to determine whether they can realistically afford to keep their house. If they can, they’ll put together a financial package that they can submit to their lender to request a loan modification. This package will consist of a hardship letter, their financial documents, and the lender application.If your application for a loan modification was turned down and you found the process intimidating or frustrating, they’ll make the experience much easier the second time around.“We know that life happens, but there are options out there for you.”If you’re on the verge of missing a payment, Maurice’s first piece of advice is to contact your lender and inform them of your situation. Lenders have programs in their imminent default area that will consider a loan modification on your behalf before you become a delinquent.If you previously received a modification and you’re on the verge of becoming a delinquent again, you can apply for another modification, but you can’t apply for the same reason as your previous application.We know that life happens, but there are options out there for you that can allow you to keep your home.
