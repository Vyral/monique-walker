        "content": "Whether you’re young or old, real estate can be a tricky thing to wrap your head around. For many people who are new to the market, it’s often helpful to explain things in the simplest way possible. I like to educate buyers and sellers in a way that’s incredibly easy to grasp — in fact, it’s so straightforward that even kids can understand it.“Although most of these steps can be a lot more in-depth, this is generally how we progress through the home selling process.”With the help of my daughter, today I’ll be explaining the seven steps a Realtor takes when helping someone sell their home:  The seller calls the Realtor.  The Realtor does a walk-through of the house. A walk-through means going through the home and checking out its features, upgrades, and condition.  The Realtor determines the price. They usually do this by seeing what similar homes sold for recently.  The Realtor lists the home on the multiple listing service (MLS). This online platform is where Realtors post a home so that other Realtors and homebuyers can see it.  The Realtor shows the property to people who want to buy the house.  The Realtor negotiates with the buyer and their Realtor to find out what they’re willing to pay for the house.  The home is sold! However, it still takes about 30 days before the sale is completed.Although most of these steps can be a lot more in-depth, this is generally how we progress through the home selling process. If you have any questions or would like more information about buying or selling a home, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "Today I’m visiting the Fat Ox restaurant in central Scottsdale to chat with head chef and owner Matt Carter. Located just a few minutes from Old Town Scottsdale and within walking distance of the new Ritz-Carlton being built, the Fat Ox is in one of the most amazing corners you can be in. Matt is also the head chef at Zinc Bistro and The Mission. Even before he opened Zinc Bistro 20 years ago, Matt wanted to open an Italian restaurant and explore Italian cuisine and the similar products we have here in Arizona such as figs, olives, and citrus. Additionally, a lot of the wheat that’s grown in Italy is also grown in the Southwest. According to Matt, really dry wheat makes for great pasta. “Just so I could make pasta, we built this restaurant,” he jokes. “Even before he opened Zinc Bistro 20 years ago, Matt wanted to open an Italian restaurant and explore Italian cuisine.”Development took many years, of course, but Matt claims that if he had opened Fat Ox at a different location with a different group, it wouldn’t have the panache that this establishment does. He grew up in the same area and has many memories of eating here, so he refers to Fat Ox’s location as a ‘legacy corner.’ It’s really a destination restaurant, which is why I was so excited to film this video and showcase it to my clients and anyone visiting Scottsdale. The view they have of the outside (see at 3:08) is practically a billboard of our city. Whether you’re traveling, here on business, or dining with family, the Fat Ox checks all the boxes.Speaking of, if you’re coming to Scottsdale soon and want to visit the Fat Ox, Matt suggests getting a Passport Dining card. That way you can sample all of his other restaurants and try different cuisines from around the world. This has become a popular option for foodies. You can get French onion soup at Zinc Bistro on a Friday night, hit up Fat Ox the next night and try their homemade pasta, and finish off the weekend with some fresh tacos at The Mission. Many thanks to Matt for letting me interview him in today’s video. If you’d like to know more about the Fat Ox, feel free to visit their website. If you have any questions for me, real estate or otherwise, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’d love to hear from you.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today I’ve invited Derek Greene of Get Your Move On to talk a little about his moving company and offer his advice to any homeowners out there facing a move. Derek started Get Your Move on when he was 24, which makes 2021 their 16th year in business. In that time, he asserts that two things have driven him: 1) never turn down any work, and 2) never leave a customer behind who has a bad taste in their mouth. “That takes work,” Derek says. “We’re not perfect in our industry—nobody is—but we work very very hard, very expeditiously, if there are challenges and issues, to resolve them right away without any questions asked.”Get Your Move On is nearly perfect in that regard as far as my past clients’ experiences go, and they were able to help roughly 2,000 families move last year. About 85% of those were residential/local moves, and the other 15% were interstate moves, so they can handle both types of arrangements. “Get Your Move On is nearly perfect in that regard in my past clients’ experiences, and they were able to help roughly 2,000 families move last year.”With so many people buying and selling homes at the same time, there are a lot of simultaneous moves happening out there. When you have a simultaneous close, you’re effectively homeless for four to 48 hours, and Get Your Move On can store your belongings inside a secure, climate-controlled warehouse overnight, which is very economical. This way, you don’t have to pay for PODS or other mini-storage options. If you think you’ll need to pursue these options, Derek invites you to give them a call so they can try solving any challenging logistical problems you may have. After that, they’ll give you a quote and let you decide what’s best for your situation. Just like Realtors, there are a lot of moving companies out there. What makes Get Your Move On Different? According to Derek, if your move carries certain challenges, about 90% of all movers there will mishandle them. Half of those, he claims, are rogue movers with malintent. The other half are simply incompetent when it comes to running a small business, which is difficult. The remaining 10% are the ones who do high-level work, and Derek and his company pride themselves on providing high-level service. “It really comes down to having a Nordstrom approach to a customer service problem. Everybody in our company has a core value of humility, and when we do have challenges, we’re not going to start figuring out whose fault it was. We’re just going to solve the problem, and then on the back end, take it as feedback on how to improve our company. I think that’s unique in a service business, as gritty and grimy as the moving business is.” If you have questions for Derek or would like to speak to him, you can reach him by phone at (480) 695-6621. If you have any real estate needs I can help you with, feel free to call or email me anytime. I’d love to hear from you.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "Right now in Maricopa County, we have about 9,800 units for sale. Last month, we sold 8,900 units, leaving us with a roughly one-month supply of homes. I can confidently say that in my 17 years of selling real estate, this is the hottest seller’s market I’ve ever seen. At the same time, it’s also the most challenging market for buyers. If your home is in decent condition and priced reasonably, it will sell. However, getting the very best price for your home still requires some finesse and expertise. Too often, sellers focus only on price and neglect the importance of selecting an offer that has the best terms overall. We’d advise all sellers to put their homes on the market on Friday and wait till that following Monday to evaluate all offers. “Getting the very best price for your home still requires some finesse and expertise.”It’s our job to correspond with buyers’ agents in such a way that promotes bidding wars. We’ll also do everything in our power to get you the best terms. For example, can we remove the appraisal contingency? Can we ask the buyer to purchase your home in as-is condition? Do you want any extra terms? Perhaps you want to stay in the home for another 30 days. We have the leverage to call those shots in this market. We’re here to do what’s best for you. No two sellers have the same life priorities; whatever’s most important to you, we can make it happen. So if you’re curious as to what your home is worth or you’re ready to sell, give us a call or send an email our way. We’d love to help you make the most of this opportunity.",

The possibilities are endless. The style, coloring, configurations, and components are incorporated to fit your needs.

Here are a few tips to help you win as a buyer:1. Get pre-approved. Pre-qualification isn’t as good as getting pre-approved. Pre-approval means you’re almost completely underwritten, which helps to minimize the close of escrow time.“Off-market properties are always a great option for buyers because there’s less competition for them.”2. Find the seller’s motivation. Have your real estate agent contact the seller’s agent to find out the seller’s motivation. For example, they may want to stay in the home a bit longer to have time to move. If we find out what’s best for the seller, the buyer can use that to get their offer accepted. 3. We match buyers to listings when possible. On our team, we list many houses, so we try to match our buyers to listings before they even hit the market. Off-market properties are always a great option for buyers because there’s less competition for them. If you’re looking for an aggressive, proactive, market-intelligent agent who cares about their clients, Melani is the one for you. Reach out to her via phone or email. If you have questions about winning in today’s market or anything else concerning real estate, contact the Monique Walker Team. We would love to help you.",

We have high demand in our market, especially from California buyers, and I don’t see that wave letting up anytime soon.“If I had a crystal ball, I believe I’d see a wonderful market next year.”3. Low interest rates. Our great interest rates drive the market right now; people are getting between 2.5% and 3%, and the Fed has said they won’t raise them for a while.With all these elements, I think 2021 will be an excellent seller’s market, and we’re eager to get started. If you’re considering buying, selling, or just have a question about the market, my team and I are here to serve you.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Many potential home sellers make their plans for the springtime, while others hope for a quick summer sale so they can move while the kids are out of school. It’s often assumed that the fall and winter markets are quieter, if not dead altogether. However, there are numerous advantages to listing your home during the holidays, and today I’m highlighting three major ones: 1. Buyers who look for a home during the holidays are more serious. If they’re pre-approved and willing to use their extra time off work to wiggle around busy holiday schedules and look at homes, they mean business. When it comes to the buyers in our end-of-year market, think quality over quantity. 2. Inventory levels are low. Currently, there’s only a one-month supply of homes; fewer options for buyers means more money for you. 3. Job-related relocations are at their peak this time of year. People who recently received a huge promotion or found a great new job in a vibrant area (like Phoenix) are rushing to find a home before their official January start date. Again, these types of buyers are just one segment of an exceptionally motivated buyer pool we see every winter. “When it comes to the buyers in our end-of-year market, think quality over quantity.”4. Houses show better when decorated for the Holidays!5. Buyers are more emotional during the Holidays, so they are more likely to pay your price.6. Buyers have more time to look for a home during the Holidays than they do during the working week.7. Some people must buy before the end of the year for tax reasons.8. You can sell now for more money and we will provide for a delayed closing or extended occupancy until early next year!9. By selling now, you may have the opportunity to be a non-contingent buyer during the Spring, when many more houses are on the market for less money! This will allow you to sell high and buy low.10. Since the supply of listings will dramatically increase in January, there will be less demand for your particular home! Less demand means less money for you!If you’re thinking about selling soon (perhaps sooner than you’d originally thought in light of this information) and want to know how much your home is worth, I’d love to help you. Just give me a call or send an email anytime! I’m here to serve you. Thank you for all of your support this year, and have a wonderful holiday season!",

Today I’m answering two more important questions.“The last housing correction was over 10 years ago, aren’t we due for another one?”You would think so. Our market typically cycles every five to seven years, but we’ve been in this one for a decade. Although we’re technically due for a correction, I don’t see one on the horizon based on our current supply and demand.“Pricing will continue to go up, but rates won’t stay this low forever.”“Good investors always sell high and buy low, so why would I want to buy now?”That’s a really good question. Are you more price-conscious or rate-conscious? Pricing is going to continue to go up over time, even if we have a downward cycle to go through. If you want a low monthly payment on your investment, however, we don’t know how much longer these historically low rates will stay.If you have any questions for us about buying, a home, or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email.

We have the lowest number of homes for sale that we’ve had in nearly a decade, which makes the market hyper-competitive. You can sell your property for a super high price, but that means you’ll also have to purchase your new home for a super high price.“You have to sell high and buy high in this market.”The ultimate question for potential buyers to answer is, “Are you in it for the short game or the long game?” We’ll probably go through another market cycle sometime in the next five to seven years, so if you sell high, buy high, and plan to stay in the home for about that long, then you’ll see solid appreciation on an asset you can enjoy every single day.

Together, we’ll tackle these questions so that you have a better understanding of the process.“I’ve heard that homes are selling fast and for more than the asking price. Why do I need a Realtor to help me sell my home when I could just pocket that money?”Yes, you could sell your home on your own, but the benefit of a Realtor is that we can generate multiple offers for your listing. That leads to competition among buyers, which in turn can lead to you receiving much more than your asking price. A Realtor can net you the most money, especially in a competitive market. More than price, we also help you get the best terms.“I always lean toward pricing a home correctly at fair market value and being more aggressive with our marketing.”“If homes are selling for over asking price, then shouldn’t I put my house on the market at a really high price and only come down if I needed?”That certainly is a strategy. I usually tell my sellers that they have two options. List it at market value, generate multiple offers, and then get top dollar when it does sell; or list it higher than market value and get fewer showings, which will usually only help your competition. So you need to decide if you want to help your competition or if you want to get more exposure for your listing.

        "content": "Today I’m joined by Melani Beauregard, one of the Monique Walker Team’s awesome buyer agents, for an interview about her growth since joining our team. Melani’s been in the real estate business for four years. In her first year, she closed fewer than 25 homes, but in her third year (after she joined us), she helped 48 families buy a home. Of course, our job isn’t just about closing deals; it’s about helping people. That’s why her goal for 2020 is to help 70 families buy a home. As of the recording of this video, she has 32 closings to her name, along with 10 pendings. Our team doesn’t like to be normal, and those numbers aren’t normal—albeit in a very good way. How did she double her production?“Well, I have a mindset that I decided I was going to surround myself with other successful people like yourself,” she says, “And I was very blessed to be invited to join your team. So, I feel like being around other people that are in the business and constantly reminding myself that I don’t know everything and that there’s always room to grow. And then just taking each experience that I’ve had and learn from it wholeheartedly. And then just constantly wanting to have the best for my clients.” “We need someone who matches our drive, hustle, and enthusiasm, so if you’re interested in filling this position, don’t hesitate to call me today.”In the two-and-a-half years Melani has been with us, she’s been able to identify our strengths in the form of a list she titled “What Being on the Monique Walker Team Means to Me.” These strengths include, in her words:  Having positive influences  Accountability   Strong integrity  Professional and experienced staff   Consistent lead flow (“There’s so much to go around I can’t to it all by myself.”)  Achieving my goals  Endless coaching   Striving to always by my best   A fun, positive environment  Financial freedom   I’m so busy I don’t have time to do my nails 😄For any agent who’s looking to join a team and needs a little more support, I think it’s a powerful message for them to know that they can do more—they just need the right environment. If anything Melani mentioned today struck a chord with you and you want to achieve the same growth in your career, you can because we’re looking for another agent to join our team. As Melani said, she can’t handle all of the leads herself. We need someone who matches our drive, hustle, and enthusiasm, so if you’re interested in filling this position, don’t hesitate to call me today. I’d love to speak with you. As always, if you have any other questions, feel free to reach out to me as well. I’m here to help.",

        "content": "Reverse mortgages are for homeowners who are at least 62 years old, have accrued a decent amount of equity (roughly 50%), and don’t want to have a mortgage payment for the rest of their lives. A reverse mortgage is a fairly complex product that warrants an in-depth conversation with your financial advisor. It’s geared for fixed-income individuals who want to stay in their homes while alleviating the burden of monthly mortgage payments. It’s also advocated by financial planners whenever there’s a downturn in the stock markets and their clients don’t want to liquidate their assets; a reverse mortgage allows them to free up a cash pool and avoid pulling money out of stocks or bonds. “A reverse mortgage is a fairly complex product that warrants an in-depth conversation with your financial advisor.”Essentially, a reverse mortgage gets paid off just like any conventional mortgage would, though it’s structured differently. If, for example, a son or daughter finds themselves needing to sell the property of a deceased parent who had a reverse mortgage, they will have 12 months from the parent’s passing to sell the property. Since a reverse mortgage loan is not to exceed the home’s value, the proceeds from the sale of the property will pay off the loan. Bay Equity Home Loans has several reverse mortgages specialists ready to answer your questions and explore whether taking out a reverse mortgage is right for you.

My goal today is to share some facts with you that point to now being a surprisingly good time to list: 1. Inventory levels are incredibly low. We already had low levels before this health crisis, but since some people are taking their homes off of the market now, listing yours will make it one of a select few options for buyers. 2. Buyers are serious. Unless they absolutely need to purchase a home, you’d expect buyers to stay on the sidelines and wait for more normal circumstances to return. While you will have fewer showings if you list now, the quality of those showings will be higher than usual because only the most motivated buyers will be looking at your home. “Now is a surprisingly great time to list your home.”3. Interest rates are very low. Though buying and selling require creativity right now, some buyers feel it’s worth it to capitalize on these rates. 4. More online searches are happening now than ever before. Buyers have more time than usual to search for homes online, and the impressions are up by 10x.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Every home seller wants top dollar for their property, so many turn to making updates and upgrades to their home in order to maximize its value.Typically, money is better spent inside the home versus outside, so you may want to wait on fixing up the driveway or investing in a newer fence, for example. Truly, the rooms that should be your focus are the kitchen and bathrooms. Buyers are searching for turnkey properties that will involve as little hassle as possible. Ideally, they want to just hand over their down payment and mortgage and move right into the home.Whenever we put up a new construction home for sale, or a home that’s already been renovated, it’s always an easier sale than trying to market a home that’s been neglected. “If you’re needing home improvements, start with the kitchen.”If you’re needing home improvements, deal with the kitchen first. This is where families spend the most time; it’s hard to imagine celebrating a holiday without all your relatives mingling in a kitchen as they load up on food. Generally, buyers love an open concept where the living room flows into a modernized kitchen with an island as a focal point. Kitchen renovations can be costly and extensive, so it’s no wonder buyers prefer properties where all the heavy lifting of remodeling has already been done and the kitchen is up-to-date and stylish. When it comes to bathrooms, you want them light, bright, and uncluttered. Design-wise, think modern, fresh, and sleek. This is the second most impactful renovation you can make. If you’re thinking about painting the interior, stop thinking and just do it! You can’t go wrong; you’ll get a 150% return on your investment, as painting is the cheapest way to make your home feel fresh and new. Buyers will see the value right away. If you have additional questions about the information covered in today’s message, feel free to call or email me. I would love to help you.",

The iBuyers of today’s market are companies like Zillow, Opendoor, Offerpad, and several other prominent names. Since I’ve worked with most of them, here are some things to consider when contemplating whether to work with iBuyers:iBuyers are so enticing because they will bring you a cash offer. Often they will close within a three- to four-week period or sooner. They may purchase the property in as-is condition. So the convenience of those offers is an extra value. However, these companies are usually purchasing properties between 10% to 20% under market value. So when you work with an iBuyer you will not net the most money off of your home sale. “Allow me to do the free due diligence for you.”Many of my clients call and say they’re considering this offer, and I am glad to go on the MLS for you, look at the property, and see what we can list and sell it for. I’ve done this hundreds of times. I’ll look at commissions, inspections, and how much you’ll net if you work with me compared to an iBuyer. Often I’m seeing that we’re able to net clients anywhere between $10,000 to $25,000 thousand more selling it though me as opposed to the iBuyer. Don’t be too hasty to take those quick offers, do your due diligence. If it makes sense, I will let you know to go ahead and move forward with those iBuyers. But allow me to do the free due diligence for you first. If you would like me to look over an iBuyer’s offer or you have any other questions, email or call me, I would be happy to help you.",

Search all Homes for SaleSelling a Phoenix Home? Check out our FREE Home Value ReportI’m here today with my preferred lender, Tom Ross from Bay Equity, to discuss a question about interest rates: “What should you do about interest rates, knowing that they’re on the rise?”Tom’s short answer is: Lock your rate in now.People have it in their head that if they just wait long enough, they’ll end up with a lower rate eventually. But rates in the 3% area are long gone; at our highest this year, we’ve brushed 5% and came back down into the high fours. This time next year, the 4% rates will be long gone as well.“Try not to turn down any showings, if possible.”Those in the market need to wrap their heads around the fact that this climb in rates we’re going into will be long-term and sustained. We’re in the midst of a sort of trade war with China, and inflation tends to raise interest rates as well. In fact, the Federal Reserve has gone on record to say that they’re going to raise the federal funds rate at least four times between now and the end of next year. Two of those jumps might occur even before the end of this year.Now the federal funds rate doesn’t directly impact mortgage rates, but as it rises, you tend to see interest rates come up.If you have any questions for Tom about rising interest rates, you can reach him at Bay Equity by calling (602) 791-5861 or by sending an email to tross@bayeq.com.For any questions about real estate in general, we always encourage you to reach out to us here at RE/MAX Excalibur.

Check out our FREE Home Value ReportAre you in the process of getting your house ready to put on the market? If so, here are a few tips to help you:1. Don’t overprice your home. Pricing is everything when marketing your home for sale. Even a well-priced home with a bad marketing plan will sell, but an overpriced home won’t.2. Failing to make repairs. If the dog chewed something up or there are other minor damages that a buyer would spot immediately, get those fixed before you get the property listed and start taking pictures.3. Neglecting to declutter your home. If you have a lot of personal items, boxes, or general clutter, that’s one of the first things a buyer will notice. As part of our services, we bring a professional stager out to our buyers’ properties to help declutter and stage the property.“Try not to turn down any showings, if possible.”4. Don’t turn down showings. To get your home sold quickly and for top dollar, it should be about when it’s most convenient for an agent to show your property, not the other way around.5. Getting overly emotional about your home. Think of your home as a property or an asset than as your home. This shift in mindset will help you maximize the sale price.If you have any questions for me or want to know why my performance outsells all those promises out there, give me a call or send me an email today.

Search all Homes for SaleSelling a Phoenix Home? Check out our FREE Home Value ReportSelling or buying a home can be one of the largest transactions of your life. A trusted consultant and Realtor can be an invaluable partner to have. When you interview a Realtor to hire, here are three really good questions to ask them:1. “How many homes have you sold in the last 12 months?” It’s interesting to find out how long an agent has been in the market, but noting their productivity in the last 12 months is a better indicator of whether or not they are a productive, full-time agent.“You want to get a sense that this agent is somebody you can trust.”2. “Can I have the contact info for your last three deals?” This question may be a surprise to the agent, but it could provide you with an honest, authentic answer to help you feel comfortable with them.3. “What specific strategies are you going to use to get my home sold?” Some agents specialize in buyer sales. Some agents specialize in listing and selling. A specific, proven plan is essential for any buyer or seller.To get my answers to these questions and more, feel free to reach out and give me a call or send me an email.

Check out our FREE Home Value ReportSpring is my favorite time to sell real estate. If you are looking to sell your home, there are three reasons why we are in a very strong seller’s market right now:1. Demand continues to increase while inventory remains low. The number of homes for sale is down 8% year over year. Why? The job outlook is strong, and more millennials are coming into the market.2. Home prices are still surging. We have appreciated 6% year over year, and I don’t see that changing anytime soon.“Our current market is great for both buyers and sellers.”3. Interest rates are rising. Right now, interest rates are at 4.5% for a 30-year fixed mortgage. Although that is a three-year high for interest rates, it is still historically low and very affordable for buyers. I don’t know how much longer this favorable situation will last.If you are looking to sell your home, now is a great time. Demand is high and prices are high, so our current market is very favorable for sellers.If you’re interested in finding out what your home is worth, we would be happy to come by and let you know what we can sell it for, how long it’s going to take, and what we’ll do to make that happen.If you have any other real estate questions, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

Check out our FREE Home Value ReportToday I’m joined by special guest Maurice Brundidge of One Home at a Time Housing Solutions to discuss how they can assist anyone who has missed several mortgage payments and is facing foreclosure.First, Maurice and his company perform a financial assessment of that individual or family to determine whether they can realistically afford to keep their house. If they can, they’ll put together a financial package that they can submit to their lender to request a loan modification. This package will consist of a hardship letter, their financial documents, and the lender application.If your application for a loan modification was turned down and you found the process intimidating or frustrating, they’ll make the experience much easier the second time around.“We know that life happens, but there are options out there for you.”If you’re on the verge of missing a payment, Maurice’s first piece of advice is to contact your lender and inform them of your situation. Lenders have programs in their imminent default area that will consider a loan modification on your behalf before you become a delinquent.If you previously received a modification and you’re on the verge of becoming a delinquent again, you can apply for another modification, but you can’t apply for the same reason as your previous application.We know that life happens, but there are options out there for you that can allow you to keep your home. If you’d like to get in touch with Maurice or would like a free consultation from him, just give him a call at (602) 703-4228.If you have any more questions for us about this topic or want to know what’s going on in our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to us.
